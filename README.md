# Wordpress-Custom-Video-Loader
WordPress Custom Video Loader" is a feature that replaces the traditional website loading spinner with a customized video. Instead of a static loading indicator, users are greeted with engaging video content while the website loads in the background. This feature enhances the user experience by providing visual interest and branding opportunities during the loading process. With customizable options for video selection and playback settings, website owners can create a unique and memorable loading experience for their visitors
